            Nigeria’s insurance industry has massive potential in a country of

// ### Why We Built Maya

// Nigeria's insurance industry holds enormous potential in a country of over 200 million people facing daily risks—from Lagos traffic accidents to theft and health emergencies. Yet, insurance penetration remains stubbornly low at just **0.4–0.5%** of GDP—one of the lowest rates in Africa and the world. Even with recent reforms like the **Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025**, which mandates faster claims settlements and stronger policyholder protections, adoption lags far behind countries like South Africa (13–14%) or Kenya (2–3%).

// Why? The biggest barrier is **lack of trust**.

// Trust erodes when insurers delay or deny claims, demand excessive documentation (often 12+ items), impose unjustified waits of 6+ weeks, or surprise customers with partial payments due to hidden clauses. Fraud suspicions, mismanagement, and outdated manual systems compound the problem. Many Nigerians simply don't understand what they're buying—complex journeys, opaque fine print, and processes that feel designed to trap rather than protect.

// As one industry leader put it: *Insurance should be simple. It should just work for everyone.* But too often, it doesn't.

// We've seen this firsthand. Claims break down exactly where trust fractures:
// - **Liability disputes** → "They're just stalling."
// - **Fraud flags** → "They're looking for excuses not to pay."
// - **Policy exclusions** → "They trapped me with fine print."
// - **Supplementary requests** → Endless back-and-forth trips for more documents (something far too many families know all too well).

// The wait isn't the real issue—**people don't hate waiting; they hate uncertainty**:
// - Not knowing what's happening with their claim.
// - Not knowing what they need to do next.
// - Not knowing if anyone is actually working on it.
// - Not knowing if they'll ever get paid.

// When trust dies, people warn others: "Don't bother with insurance." Word spreads, penetration stays low, and an essential safety net remains out of reach for millions.

// Insurance isn't fundamentally a technology problem—it's a **complexity management problem**. The lifecycle is non-linear: full of loops, branches, disputes, and iterations that legacy systems and manual processes can't handle transparently or efficiently.

// That's why we built Maya in Lagos, for Nigeria.

// Maya is a multi-agent AI system designed from the ground up to orchestrate this complexity—reducing uncertainty with real-time updates, plain-language explanations (in English, Pidgin, or local languages), and fair, fast resolutions. We want insurance to finally "just work": rebuilding trust one transparent claim at a time, so more Nigerians can protect what matters most.

// **Time is Trust.** Maya gives it back.

// This section slots perfectly after "Maya's Capabilities" and before "Maya's Impact" (or replace/merge with "About Maya"). It keeps the clean, confident Devin-inspired tone: honest about the problem, data-backed, personal/emotional, and forward-looking.

// If you want it shorter, more personal (e.g., add your dad's story explicitly), or paired with different visuals, let me know! 🚀

// Why We Built Maya: Because Time is Trust
// In Nigeria, insurance isn’t a technology problem. It’s a complexity management problem.

// The industry is at a breaking point. Despite the Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act 2025, public trust remains at an all-time low. We built Maya because we saw a system where the "fine print" was a barrier, not a bridge, and where the "6-week wait" wasn't just a delay—it was a message to the customer that they didn't matter.

// The Crisis of Trust
// The biggest hurdle in Nigerian insurance is the inability to pay claims predictably. This isn't always because the money isn't there; it's because the process is designed to fail.

// The Document Wall: Requiring 12+ documents for a simple claim is a feature of legacy systems, not a bug.

// The "Clause XYZ" Trap: Customers feel "trapped" by technical grounds and partial payments.

// The Black Hole: As Mr. Philip (CDO) noted, insurance should be simple. But when a process is non-linear—looping between disputes, fraud flags, and policy lapses—human teams get overwhelmed, and the customer is left in the dark.

// The "Uncertainty" Factor
// We realized that people don't actually hate waiting; they hate uncertainty. When a claim enters a liability dispute, the "6-week silence" breeds four toxic thoughts:

// I do not know what is happening.

// I don’t know what I need to do.

// I don’t know if they are actually working on it.

// I do not know if I will actually get paid.

// Time is Trust. Every hour a claim sits idle is an hour of trust dying.

// Why Maya? Why Now?
// Traditional automation can only handle the "happy path"—the 30% of cases where everything is perfect. But Nigerian life isn't a straight line. 70% of claims involve loops, disputes, and messy evidence.

// We built Maya to handle the 70%.

// Maya’s agentic system treats every policyholder like a priority. By orchestrating specialized agents that can "reason" through a liability dispute or explain a complex clause in Pidgin or Yoruba, we remove the human bottlenecks that lead to "stalling."

// Maya exists to ensure that:

// Underwriting is transparent and instant, so you know exactly what you’re getting into.

// Claims are resolved through collaboration, not confrontation.

// Communication is proactive, killing uncertainty before it starts.

// We didn't just build an AI; we built a way for the Nigerian insurance industry to keep its promises.
